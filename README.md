This repo is for a API for getting info about fishes in stardew valley.
Currently, it only displays all the fish which can be caught with a fishing pole.

# API Functionality
The API currently lets you fetch a fish's information by name or fetching all fishes by their location or season.
You can also fetch information about all fishes. To do this, the API makes use of fishes.json, which is generated by running the web scraper. The web scraper scrapes the stardew valley wiki for all entries of fish. All entries are not always formatted in the same way, therefore there can be some confusing information on some entries, such as "All" being listed as seasons for fish that can be found on ginger Island. Info like that can be implied, by having Ginger Island listed as a location, and as such does not need to be part of the season entry.



## Routes
These are all the routes that my API currently has.
### /fish
This route returns all the fish entries.
## /fish/<name>
Returns a fish entry based on name of the fish.
## /fish/location/<location>
Returns all fish entries that can be found in the specified location.
